# Texas

Texas is a learning project. 
The idea here is to create a sample dotnet project 

The idea here is to track information about a project that has three tiers. 
An epic has zero or more stor{y, ies}. 
A story has zero or more task(s).

The details are intentionally fuzzy for now.

## Disclaimer 

This is not a real world project and any resemblance is merely a coincidence.
